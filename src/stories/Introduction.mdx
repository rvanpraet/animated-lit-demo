# Welcome to Animated Lit Components

This Storybook serves as the living documentation and development environment for a collection of high-performance, standalone web components built with **Lit** and **TypeScript**.

## Why this Storybook exists

Building modern web applications requires a consistent, reusable set of UI building blocks. This library focuses on combining:

- **Performance**: Leveraging the standard Web Components API for native browser speed.
- **Micro-animations**: Integrating GSAP for smooth, delightful interactions.
- **Advanced Visuals**: Using WebGL and GLSL shaders for premium background effects.
- **Type Safety**: Fully authored in TypeScript for a robust developer experience.

## Component Categorization

We organize our components based on their complexity and responsibility:

- **UI Blocks**: Fundamental pieces like buttons, inputs, and icons.
- **Composite Components**: Combined elements that form functional units, like cards or search bars.
- **Sections**: Full-width page segments designed for specific marketing or UI purposes (e.g., Hero Landing).
- **Layouts**: Structural containers that define the overall grid and positioning of sections.
